Current Versions
----------------
Racket     5.2.1                   (Feb, 2012)
Whalesong  dyoo-whalesong-b7ca540  (Feb 10th, 2012) 


Goals
-----
The goals of this project are:

* to write mathematical exercises for students  
* to create a framework that makes it possible for
  teachers easily to write and submit new exercises

Inspiration
-----------
The inspiration to start this this project was the exercises on 
[Khan Academy | Practice](http://http://www.khanacademy.org/exercisedashboard "Khan Academy").
The idea of the practicing until one gets a streak of 10 correctly solved
problems in a row works very well in a class room setting, where students
normally dislike drill exercises.

Khan Academy has a system of points and badges motivates. This motivates many 
students due to the game like feel. 

Focus
-----
The focus will for the time being be on writing exercises relevant for
a high school audience.

Programming Language
--------------------
This project will use [Racket](http://www.racket-lang.org/) in the form 
of [Whalesong](http://hashcollision.org/whalesong/ "Whalesong").

Whalesong allows the main components to be written in Racket and still
use relevant JavaScript libraries.

* [Raphaël](http://raphaeljs.com "Raphaël) is used for graphical exercises
* [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org "MathJax") is used to display mathematical expressions
* [Khan Academy's Scratchpad](http://github.com/Khan/khan-exercises/blob/master/utils/scratchpad.js "Scratchpad")
  orignally [Antimatter15's Scratcpad](http://github.com/antimatter15/scratchpad "Scratchpad") 
  is used as, well, a scratchpad.
