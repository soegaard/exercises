;; A rewrite of the cloth simulation application from the Codea project

;; There are a few things about the program that aren't stated up front, but are implied
;; by the original code:
;;
;; 1.  The upper edge is fixed.  The use of the orx, ory attributes is somewhat redundant.
;; 2.  The particles
