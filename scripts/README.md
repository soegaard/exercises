planet-link-whalesong.sh
========================
This script tells planet to use the Whalesong version in whalesong/current.
If the planet development link is not set, racket will use the old version
at planet.racket-lang.org.

planet-unlink-whalesong.sh
==========================
Thus removes the development link.

setup-whalesong.sh
==================
This runs 'raco setup' on the current whalesong source.
Without precompiling Whalesong to bytecode, compilation 
will be slow.

=======
Open stxmat-exercises.xhml in Chrome.
